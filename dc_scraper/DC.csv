Co-operative education (co-op)
The best way to succeed in your field is to immerse yourself in it! Co-op is an excellent way to build your professional network, explore career paths and apply in-class teachings to real work situations. Co-op is a model of education that integrates academic learning with workplace learning in fields relevant to our students’ academic and personal goals.
Students in the Business Administration – Accounting Advanced Diploma program will be invited to apply to the co-op option during their first year of study. Entrance to the co-op option is limited and the processes for securing a work term are competitive. Students enrolled in the co-op option are required to complete a four-month, paid work term between the second and third years of their program.
Supports are available through the Experiential Learning office to assist students with securing their work terms. In addition, the Experiential Learning office is in contact with co-op students and their employers during the work terms to help with any questions. Upon completing the work term, co-op students return to campus to complete their final two academic semesters to the program before graduating.

Enrolment considerations
It is important for individuals interested in this program to consider that the topics covered (e.g. trauma, abuse, suicidality, overdose), as well as images and videos shown in some courses can potentially be emotionally dysregulating to some.

These topics and images are an unavoidable aspect of working in this field, therefore it is important that before entering the program, prospective students strongly consider if they are able to experience these aspects of the program without becoming excessively emotionally dysregulated.

	Experiential Learning	
Walls to Bridges (W2B) is an optional experiential learning course, offering a unique opportunity for college and correctional students to co-create learning within a prison classroom setting. Through dialogue and shared inquiry, students explore course content that is both academic and experiential in nature. Space is limited and as such, students will be required to engage in an interview process prior to selection. Once selected, students will be required to attend a presentation by prison representatives at Durham College to understand the prison rules and expectations. The “Resiliency in Society” W2B course examines resilience and its intersection with social justice. Together, inside and outside students critically examine definitions of resilience from psychological and sociological perspectives; explore constructs such as power, privilege, access, and agency and consider the implications for resilience. Students are introduced to various Canadian narratives and real-life examples of resilience at the individual and social group level.
 
Campus Conflict Resolution Services (CCRS) is an experiential learning course, offering a unique opportunity for CRMD students to engage in all aspects of running a conflict resolution business on campus. Providing education and intervention services, CCRS enables CRMD students to build confidence and competency as they apply the knowledge and skills they are learning in the program.

	Experiential Learning	
Students get several opportunities to volunteer for experiential learning events which directly relate to learning and performing the duties of a court clerk/registrar in the field.  The pictures below show two CTSS students who acted as court clerks during the mock trial for the Project Lord Ridgeback event.  The students in the program also act as court registrars at the Durham Courthouse for the Paralegal program college and Ontario wide mock trials learning and working with real judges!
Field Placement
Your learning experience will be complemented by a field placement, which will provide the opportunity to integrate theory with practice under the supervision of an industry professional. Durham College’s Court Support Services certificate program was the first program in Ontario to focus on employment within court services as well as court-related positions in the justice sector. It distinguishes itself from other programs due to the field placement course which allows students to choose placement in specific court support positions.
The most significant part of the program is the field observations in first semester visiting many levels of court and the one-on-one shadowing component in second semester.
Please note: You are required to complete criminal record and judicial matters checks prior to entering into your second semester field placement.
Project Lord Ridgeback
Project Lord Ridgeback (PLRB) is multi-disciplinary experiential learning exercise that simulates a local disaster. Interacting with actors who play victims, casualties, emotionally distressed persons and the elderly in a staged, choreographed event, students from a wide range of programs learn by acting and responding as they would in real emergencies. Subject matter experts design injects into disaster-related scenarios which simulate authentic workplace demands.
Following the mock disaster, students participate in follow up exercises to apply learning in mock court testimony, critical incident stress debrief, crime-scene lab work, and form completion specific to their program areas.
Student participants are from a wide range of DC programs including: Practical Nursing, Primary Care Paramedic, Police Foundations, Protection Security & Investigation, Paralegal, 911 Call Centre Communications, Advanced Law Enforcement and Investigations, Journalism Mass Media Program, Social Service Worker, Activation Co-ordination – Gerontology, Court Support Services.

Program Details
NOTE: Students enrolling in this program are required to purchase their own laptop. For specific hardware and software requirements for this program click here.
This program was created by DC and Ontario Tech for individuals who plan to take Ontario Tech’s Bachelor of Commerce (Hons) degree program. The bridging courses required for admission to the degree program are embedded in the curriculum and if you achieve a minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.5 in each semester of your DC courses and no grade below C in your Ontario Tech courses, you can apply directly to the third year of the degree program. This opportunity allows qualified candidates to major in Entrepreneurship at Ontario Tech; however, acceptance is based on Ontario Tech approval with higher marks required. The Ontario Tech embedded courses are flexible and subject to change by the university. Academic planning assistance will be offered to you by a DC student advisor representative.
As a student participating in this program, you will be registered at DC and at Ontario Tech. Ontario Tech offers classes in the evenings and the annual calendars including reading week are generally different. Students are expected to attend all classes that are scheduled.  In addition, the two institutions use different learning management systems.
For more information please visit the Ontario Tech’s Bachelor of Commerce (Hons) Frequently Asked Questions.
Please note: You will apply to the Entrepreneurship and Small Business – Business – Transfer to Ontario Tech Bachelor of Commerce (Honours) program at www.ontariocolleges.ca using the BETU application code. Upon meeting the selection criteria and achieving the required grades, you will be eligible to complete the Bachelor of Commerce (Honours) degree at Ontario Tech.
This program enables students to complete the Entrepreneurship and Small Business – Business diploma at DC and the Bachelor of Commerce (Honours) at Ontario Tech in four years for qualifying students, and at less cost than a typical Bachelor degree program.
This program provides students with the option of proceeding in second year with the college-only curriculum to complete the Entrepreneurship and Small Business – Business diploma, or proceeding to complete the university transfer, which will include five university credits.
This unique pathway is available on a shared campus with exposure to college and university faculty, information and opportunities. Students can transfer to the first-year of any other business program at DC after the first semester and graduate after the second year with an Entrepreneurship and Small Business – Business diploma.
Students can also earn the following globally recognized certificates by taking Microsoft Office Specialist exams as part of their computer courses:
Microsoft Office Specialist: Word Associate (COMP1209)
Microsoft Office Specialist: PowerPoint Associate (COMP1209)
Microsoft Office Specialist: Excel Associate (COMP2209)
Microsoft Office Specialist: Excel Expert (if applicable currently will be offered in Accounting and Supply Chain programs)
Students who successfully pass all three exams can earn an extra certificate that recognizes their accomplishment with the Microsoft Office Specialist: Associate (Office 365 and Office 2019) certificate.

Co-operative education (co-op)
The best way to succeed in your field is to immerse yourself in it! Co-op is an excellent way to build your professional network, explore career paths and apply in-class teachings to real work situations. Co-op is a model of education that integrates academic learning with workplace learning in fields relevant to our students’ academic and personal goals. 
Students in the Business Administration – Finance Advanced Diploma program will be invited to apply to the co-op option during their first year of study. Entrance to the co-op option is limited and the processes for securing a work term are competitive.  Students enrolled in the co-op option are required to complete a four-month, paid work term between the second and third years of their program.
Supports are available through the Experiential Learning office to assist students with securing their work terms. In addition, the Experiential Learning office is in contact with co-op students and their employers during the work terms to help with any questions. Upon completing the work term, co-op students return to campus to complete their final two academic semesters of the program before graduating.

Co-operative education (co-op)
The best way to succeed in your field is to immerse yourself in it! Co-op is an excellent way to build your professional network, explore career paths and apply in-class teachings to real work situations. Co-op is a model of education that integrates academic learning with workplace learning in fields relevant to our students’ academic and personal goals.
Students in the Fire Prevention and Technology Advanced Diploma program will be invited to apply to the co-op option during their second academic semester. Entrance to the co-op option is limited and the processes for securing a work term are competitive.  Students enrolled in the co-op option are required to complete a four-month, paid work term between the fourth and fifth semesters of their program.
Supports are available through Experiential Learning to assist students with securing their work terms. In addition, Experiential Learning is in contact with co-op students and their employers during the work terms to help with any questions. Upon completing the work term, co-op students return to campus to complete their final two academic semesters of the program before graduating.

Program Details
HR professionals work in partnership with business managers to take care of a company’s largest asset – its people. To help a business run, HR staff provide advice to department supervisors on a range of employee-related issues, design and deliver a host of programs and services focused on individual and team needs, and create company policies that support and promote a workplace culture based on fairness, equity and personal and professional growth.
HR professionals serve as strategic partners in today’s business environment. They work closely with management colleagues at all levels of a company on a variety of project-based and proactive initiatives. Many roles are performed by HR professionals including the following:
Advocating on a variety of staff issues
Developing and implementing company policies, procedures, programs and services
Giving advice and counsel to corporate executives, line managers and employees
This program will develop your skills, knowledge and abilities in the following areas:
Introduction to Human Resources management
Recruitment and selection
Occupational health and safety
Organizational behaviour
Training and development
Conflict resolution
Students will gain hands-on experience with the full version of eNETEmployer from CanPay Payroll Software. eNETEmployer is used across the country to produce in excess of 10 million pay cheques, EFT and other payments each year.
These careers may lead to management roles that oversee general HR services in small-to-medium sized organizations or to senior HR specialist positions in large organizations.
Courses offered in the HRTU program by DC and Ontario Tech qualify towards the academic component of the Certified Human Resources Professional (CHRP) designation. Students who receive and average grade of 70 per cent in these courses and maintain a minimum grade of 65 per cent in each course meet the coursework requirements to write the Comprehensive Knowledge Exams – a significant step towards obtaining this important designation from the HRPA. Please visit www.hrpa.ca for full details.
This program was created by DC and Ontario Tech for individuals who plan to take Ontario Tech’s Honours Bachelor of Commerce degree program. The bridging courses required for admission to the degree program are embedded in the curriculum and if you achieve a minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.5 in each semester of your DC courses and no grade below C in your Ontario Tech course, you may apply directly to the third year of the degree program. This opportunity allows qualified candidates to major in Organizational Behaviour and Human Resources Management at Ontario Tech. In order to participate in this program, you are required to maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.5 and complete an application to Ontario Tech in the first semester. The Ontario Tech-embedded courses are flexible and subject to change by Ontario Tech. Academic planning assistance will be offered to you by a student advisor representative.

For more information please visit the Human Resources – Business – Transfer to Ontario Tech University Bachelor of Commerce (Hons) Frequently Asked Questions.
This program enables students to complete the Business – Human Resources diploma at DC and Bachelor of Commerce Honours program at Ontario Tech in four years for qualifying students, and at less cost than a four-year degree program
This program provides students with the option of proceeding in second year with the college-only curriculum to complete the standard two-year Business – Human Resources diploma or proceeding to complete the two-year university transfer, which will include five university credits
This unique pathway is available on a shared campus with exposure to college and university faculty, information and opportunities.
Students have flexibility including the ability to transfer to any other first-year business program at DC after the first semester.

Program Details
This program embraces the broad changes occurring in the media landscape and offers a progressive curriculum that will allow you to focus on development of journalism, social media skills and content creation on all platforms – online, print and broadcast, including podcasts.
For a quick overview of the program, please watch this 90-second video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyoieRxlVBE
Students in the Journalism – Mass Media program will develop the essential skills, knowledge, and behaviours required to work in this progressive, critical profession. In their first year, students are introduced to the core journalism skills and learn how society functions both locally and globally (see link to Global Class below). In their second year, students focus on creating content for all media platforms and undergoing experiential learning through our ‘working newsroom’ (see links to The Chronicle and Riot Radio below).
Due to the constant evolution of technology and the increasing development of new platforms of communication, traditional media professions such as journalism are facing new opportunities, as well as new challenges. Changes in the delivery methods of traditional news have forced journalists and others within the journalism industry to change how they do their jobs. For instance, journalists can now collect information with their phones and deliver stories directly to multiple platforms.
Graduates will have developed skills in: broadcasting, podcasting, reporting, interviewing, editing, writing, content creation and media production, teamwork and critical thinking. You will have knowledge of applicable legislation, standards and professional ethics, and recognize the importance of continuous learning. More specifically, you will gain a clear understanding of the impact of digital technology on journalism and will be able to respond and adapt effectively and efficiently to technological changes.
Upon successful completion of this program you will have opportunities at an entry-level in a wide variety of news organizations and as content creators for a variety of private companies and public organizations, such as school boards, hospitals and governments. Graduates will have the skills to perform a range of tasks, including:
Writing local, national and international news through interviews and research
Writing news stories for publication and/or broadcast
Editing, analyzing and verifying information for accuracy
Researching and conducting interviews for broadcast, online and print
Applying production skills and using equipment to create content for a range of platforms
Using social media platforms to engage audiences
Planning and designing editorial content to meet a mass communications strategy for a client
Durham’s Journalism – Mass Media program has successfully covered the campus and community since 1974. It has an ongoing history of excellence, winning Ontario Community Newspaper Association honours on a regular basis.
Our graduates have a track record of producing quality work across Canada – for news organizations such as the Toronto Star, CBC, CTV, Global News, the Score, TSN, the New York Times and National Geographic, and in communities from British Columbia to Nova Scotia. Grads have also earned careers as content creators and social media coordinators for companies, agencies and institutions.

This program was created by DC and Ontario Tech for individuals who plan to take Ontario Tech’s Bachelor of Commerce (Hons) degree program. The bridging courses required for admission to the degree program are embedded in the curriculum and if you achieve a minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.5 in each semester of your DC courses and no grade below C in your Ontario Tech courses, you can apply directly to the third year of the degree program. This opportunity allows qualified candidates to major in Marketing at Ontario Tech. In order to participate in this program, you are required to maintain a cumulative grade point average of 3.5 and complete an application to Ontario Tech in the first semester.  The Ontario Tech embedded courses are flexible and subject to change by Ontario Tech.

Ontario Tech offers classes in the evenings and the annual calendars including reading week are generally different. Students are expected to attend all classes that are scheduled. In addition, the two institutions use different learning management systems.
Please note: You will apply to the Marketing – Business program at www.ontariocolleges.ca using the MKTU application code. Upon meeting the selection criteria and achieving the required grades, you will be eligible to complete your Bachelor of Commerce (Hons) degree at Ontario Tech.

Co-operative education (co-op)
The best way to succeed in your field is to immerse yourself in it! Co-op is an excellent way to build your professional network, explore career paths and apply in-class teachings to real work situations. Co-op is a model of education that integrates academic learning with workplace learning in fields relevant to our students’ academic and personal goals. 
Students in the Business Administration – Marketing Advanced Diploma program will be invited to apply to the co-op option during their first year of study. Entrance to the co-op option is limited and the processes for securing a work term are competitive. Students enrolled in the co-op option who qualify for co-op will be eligible to complete a four-month, paid work term between the second and third years of their program.
Supports are available through the Experiential Learning office to assist students with securing their work terms. In addition, the Experiential Learning office is in contact with co-op students and their employers during the work terms to help with any questions. Upon completing the work term, co-op students return to campus to complete their final two academic semesters of the program before graduating.

Program Details
This fast-track program is for eligible domestic or internationally educated professionals with a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree.
The two semesters will provide you with the training and hands-on experience necessary to begin a career in non-destructive evaluation/testing (NDE/NDT). In combination with your degree those skills will allow for you to assess the data collection from the inspections and provide reports to senior management.
NDT inspectors engage in the examination and testing of cars, trains, airplanes, space craft towers, bridges, ships, power plants, amusement park rides etc. You will learn how to examine these objects without causing damage or impairment to their future use, hence the term non-destructive. You will also learn how testing in this fashion is used to detect possible internal or external defects and examine the properties of the object.
At the end of the program, you will be eligible to take method-specific certification exams regulated by the Canadian General Standards Board if you have 70 per cent or better in the related NDT courses.
Program Learning OutcomesComplete all work in compliance with current legislation, standards, regulations and guidelines.Apply quality control and quality assurance procedures to meet organizational standards and requirements.Comply with current health and safety legislation, as well as organizational practices and procedures.Apply sustainability best practices in workplaces.Use current and emerging technologies to support the implementation of mechanical engineering projects.Analyze and solve mechanical problems by applying mathematics and fundamentals of mechanical engineering.Interpret, prepare and modify mechanical engineering drawings and other related technical documents.Contribute to the design and the analysis of mechanical components, processes and systems applying fundamentals of mechanical engineering.Manufacture, assemble, maintain and repair mechanical components according to required specifications.Verify the specifications of materials, processes and operations to support the design and production of mechanical components.Contribute to the planning, implementation and evaluation of projects.Develop strategies for ongoing personal and professional development to enhance work performance.

Program Overview
Accredited by the Law Society of Ontario (LSO), this program qualifies graduates to apply to write the LSO’s licensing examination, successful completion of which qualifies the graduate to become an LSO member as a professional, licensed paralegal. Unique to Ontario, the paralegal profession was established to provide affordable legal representation and access to the justice system for people who find themselves facing charges under provincial law or some Criminal Code provisions; those who require legal assistance in dealing with government agencies and tribunals in areas such as human rights, social assistance, immigration and workers compensation; and those who are embroiled in disputes involving residential tenancies or small claims court. 
Whether you provide paralegal services in your own professional capacity, as a member of a law or paralegal firm, or as an employee of a government agency, your passion and integrity combined with extensive skills and knowledge, will make you the ideal legal representative for those challenged by the law.

Program Details
Durham College is offering new and exciting ways to complete your education.  Starting September 2022, the Law Society of Ontario has approved Durham College to offer up to 35% of classes in the Paralegal Programs online during a two year pilot project.  As a result, students will be required to have access to a computer with video and audio.  Please see the link for Tech Recommendations for further suggestions.
Whether you provide paralegal services in your own professional capacity, as a member of a law or paralegal firm, or as an employee of a government agency, your passion and integrity combined with extensive skills and knowledge, will make you the ideal legal representative for those challenged by the law.
This program is accredited by the Law Society of Ontario (Law Society), the regulatory body governing professional paralegals in the province, and meets its rigorous competencies for paralegals. It will prepare you for the Law Society’s paralegal licensing examination, which graduates are eligible to write, and is designed to provide the specialized knowledge and skills required to independently provide legal services as a professional, licensed paralegal or work as a paralegal under the supervision of a lawyer.
Graduates who successfully complete the Law Society of Ontario’s Licensing Examination are recognized as Professional Licensed Paralegals and are afforded the privilege of providing legal services in prescribed areas of law before many courts and tribunals in Ontario, such as Small Claims Court, Provincial Offences Court, Criminal Summary Conviction matters, the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal, and the Landlord and Tenant Board, to name a few.  Graduates may also find employment in law firms, working under the supervision of a licensed lawyer or paralegal, immigration and refugee law, as well as in several organizations approved by the LSO in By-Law #4.
Furthermore, Graduates may decide to continue their education and achieve further academic credentials.  For example, they may apply to the College’s Law Clerk Advanced Fast Track Program and, after completing four courses during a Spring/Summer semester, become enrolled in the third year of the three-year Law Clerk Advanced Program, successful completion of which would see the student achieve both a Paralegal Diploma and Law Clerk Advanced Diploma in three years.  In addition, there are many favourable “bridging” opportunities to universities through which graduates can achieve a university degree in a condensed period of time.
The Paralegal Program offers pro bono (no cost) student representation for matters before the Social Security Tribunal (“SST”). If you are seeking assistance with your SST appeal, please contact Kandace.BondWileman@DurhamCollege.ca.

Program Details
Developed in response to the growing need for legal representation and access to the justice system, this degree program prepares students with the knowledge, skills and expertise required to work in a variety of legal fields.
The Honours Bachelor of Paralegal (HBPL) program is grounded in the entry-level competencies of a licensed paralegal in Ontario and the complex legal thinking required to practice in court and tribunal proceedings. In Canada, legal services are not exclusively provided by lawyers, there are professions that provide legal services under varying degrees of lawyer supervision, including law clerks, legal assistants and paralegals. In Ontario, Paralegal is established as a licensed and regulated profession that can work independently within a prescribed scope of practice.
Students in the HBPL program explore and examine constitutional law and the Charter, criminal and summary convictions, contracts and tort law, the law of Tribunals, the procedure and practice for small claims court, the theory and strategies of negotiations and mediation, insurance law and employment law.
Courses in this program will provide students with the legal context they require as well as the cultural competency lens to provide legal services to diverse populations including immigrants, refugees, Indigenous peoples, women and people who identify as 2SLGBTQIA+. To best serve their future clients, students will gain an in-depth understanding of human rights claims, disability applications, Immigration and Refugee Board hearings, criminal code offences involving those who have experienced inter-generational trauma and applications involving mental health, housing and financial stability issues.
Through a comprehensive mix of theoretical, research and applied courses, students will apply their knowledge in a mandatory 14-week, 420-hour experiential field placement. Students will be equipped with the knowledge and skills required to successfully apply their expertise and professional practice in a legal setting with the ability to translate theoretical learning to the actual field. DC’s Faculty of Social and Community Services is dedicated to assisting students securing their field placement and supports them throughout the process.

Program Details
Durham College is offering new and exciting ways to complete your education.  Starting September 2022, the Law Society of Ontario has approved Durham College to offer up to 35% of classes in the Paralegal Programs online during a two year pilot project.  As a result, students will be required to have access to a computer with video and audio.  Please see the link for Tech Recommendations for further suggestions.
Whether you provide paralegal services in your own professional capacity, as a member of a law or paralegal firm, or as an employee of a government agency, your passion and integrity combined with extensive skills and knowledge, will make you the ideal legal representative for those challenged by the law.
This program is accredited by the Law Society of Ontario (Law Society), the regulatory body governing professional paralegals in the province, and meets its rigorous competencies for paralegals. It will prepare you for the Law Society’s paralegal licensing examination, which graduates are eligible to write, and is designed to provide the specialized knowledge and skills required to independently provide legal services as a professional, licensed paralegal or work as a paralegal under the supervision of a lawyer.
The graduate certificate program is also designed specifically for individuals who have a degree or diploma consisting of law-related courses or three to five years of legal-related experience. Upon licensing by the Law Society, you will be able to provide legal services within authorized areas of practice.
Graduates who successfully complete the Law Society of Ontario’s Licensing Examination are recognized as Professional Licensed Paralegals and are afforded the privilege of providing legal services in prescribed areas of law before many courts and tribunals in Ontario, such as Small Claims Court, Provincial Offences Court, Criminal Summary Conviction matters, the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal, and the Landlord and Tenant Board, to name a few.  Graduates may also find employment in law firms, working under the supervision of a licensed lawyer or paralegal, immigration and refugee law, as well as in several organizations approved by the LSO in By-Law #4.
Furthermore, Graduates may decide to continue their education and achieve further academic credentials.  For example, they may apply to the College’s Law Clerk Advanced Fast Track Program and, after completing four courses during a Spring/Summer semester, become enrolled in the 3rd year of the 3 year Law Clerk Advanced Program, successful completion of which would see the student achieve both a Paralegal Diploma and Law Clerk Advanced Diploma in 3 years.  In addition, there are many favourable “bridging” opportunities to Universities at which graduates can achieve a university degree in a condensed period of time.
The Paralegal Program offers pro bono (no cost) student representation for matters before the Social Security Tribunal (“SST”). If you are seeking assistance with your SST appeal, please contact Kandace.BondWileman@DurhamCollege.ca.
Program Learning OutcomesUnderstand the structure, work and organization of the Ontario court system, and of quasi-judicial administrative boards, tribunals and regulatory bodies. Understand the principles of law and the formal procedures attached to proceedings initiated by the Crown under the Provincial Offences Act. Appreciate the basic principles underlying tort law and the law of contracts, with particular emphasis on areas of permitted practice. Appreciate the basic principles underlying a variety of legal processes, including real property law, wills and estates, power of attorney, business organization, construction lien rights and bankruptcy, immigration, and residential tenancy. Make effective client representations before courts and administrative boards and tribunals in areas of permitted practice. Understand the limitations currently defining areas of practice for client advocates or agents who are not qualified legal practitioners, and the clear lines of demarcation and authority defining areas of unauthorized practice. Demonstrate effective oral and written communication skills, and appropriate interpersonal skills in support of client relationships. Demonstrate effective administrative and business management skills, including facility in basic accounting techniques and micro-computer applications, office organization and case management, and the ability to develop and implement a realistic business operating plan. Appreciate the importance of business ethics and professional responsibility to clients, particularly in a legal environment.

	Field Placement	
Practicum
The Paramedic Advanced Care program features a series of practicum opportunities in all semesters of the program.  Practicum facilitates the application of concepts taught in the program through skills and simulated scenario-based practice progressing to practice in hospital based rotations and finally to an on-car preceptorship under the supervision of professional Advanced Care Paramedics.
Students will acquire problem solving and clinical decision making skill through the acceptance of a series of graded responsibilities progressing towards competency. The opportunity to practice in a simulated setting allows the learner to practice skills and decision making in a safe controlled laboratory setting.
All evaluations are conducted in accordance with the Paramedic Association of Canada’s (PAC) definition of competency.
Eligibility
Students must have a Paramedic Ontario College Diploma or completed an Accreditation Canada accredited Primary Care Paramedic program. Students will be required to provide a Criminal Reference Check (CRC) with Vulnerable Sector Screening (VSS). If you cannot provide a clear CRC, you will be denied the opportunity to enter your placement and this will impact your ability to complete your full program and/or secure employment.
Field Placement Documentation
In order to maintain confidentiality and security, the program utilizes an independent provider, Verified by Synergy Gateway for field placement documentation collection and validation.  This process is the Electronic Student Permit Checking (ESPC).  There is a cost associated with this external agency.  Please refer to the Paramedic Advanced Care ESPC Information Package for details.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Living Lab
The Living Lab at Durham College mimics a typical residential unit, allowing students to work through real-life scenarios that depict several challenges they will face in their future careers. Complete with obstacles to problem solve and work around, such as a living room, bedroom, kitchen, and laundry room, students learn to not only care for the patient, but to be mindful of their environment as well. In an emergency, a person’s life can depend on the decision making and the abilities of the paramedic to take swift action; the Living Lab ensures that the students are well prepared and confident to meet the demand of this challenging career head on. Students plan and try out what they learn in the lab and are able to apply the new knowledge to future situations. By going beyond the theory learned in class and learning by doing, students get first-hand experience of practicing what has been taught to retain the life-saving skills and knowledge necessary to succeed.

Program Overview
Personal hygiene, mobility, preparing meals and taking essential medication are elements of daily life that most people take for granted, but there are many individuals who are unable to perform these tasks independently. The personal support worker (PSW) is the front-line care provider whose responsibilities focus on the provision of personal care and support that include activities of daily living with client populations across all institutional, community care and service settings. PSWs provide compassionate, client-centred care to enhance and maintain the quality of everyday life. Through dedicated faculty, enhanced curriculum, skills and certifications obtained in the course of study, and implementation of several interprofessional education and simulation opportunities, our students graduate well-prepared and job-ready. In fact, our recent PSW student and graduate satisfaction rate was 100 per cent (2018-2019).
This program is also offered in a flexible weekend delivery format. To learn more, visit www.durhamcollege.ca/PSFL.

With weekend delivery, labs are still offered in-person and supported to the same standards as our traditional weekday classes.

Field placements are completed on the weekend.
The weekend delivery format will cover the same material as the traditional weekday program. To learn more about the traditional weekday program, visit www.durhamcollege.ca/PSWK.

Special pricing has been secured to give you the best possible value on your camera purchase. For details and participating locations please review the Canon Student Advantage Program Pricing webpage.
Students are required to purchase a digital camera in order to complete the course work and assignments in the Photography program. Please see the below suggested cameras. The hardware, software and photographic equipment used in this program are needed to teach the advanced technology skills required in the workplace.
Media Equipment Loans in the School of Media, Art & Design (MAD) have an inventory of accessories available for students enrolled in this program including:
Flashes
Studio lights
Tripods
Variety of specialty lenses made by Canon
Please note: the lenses will only fit Canon cameras so this should be a consideration when choosing your camera. MAD does not stock any lenses other than Canon for student lending.
Important Notice
Due to supply chain issues it is advised you purchase your camera well in advance of the fall start up
As you begin to prepare for college, we wanted to inform you of a special membership program with Canon Canada that allows you to shop at any authorized dealer for the best price and get discounts as a member of the Canon Student Advantage Program Membership gives students discounts on the dealer's best pricing for eligible equipment, at time of purchase.  For complete details, please visit Canon Canada's website.  For example, a member of the program gets an additional $125 discount on the Canon EOS R Body with the kit lens W/RF 24-105mm IS STM Lens. Pricing and discounts are subject to change. Please see Canon's site for details.
There are three recommended models of mirrorless cameras that you may consider and each will meet the academic requirements of your program.
Our professors have extensive professional experience and recommend the Canon EOS R body with the kit lens W/RF 24-105mm IS STM Lens (Retail $2,399) as ideal for incoming students.  Designed with advanced features and functions, this camera meets all the needs and expectations for this program.  Students will seamlessly integrate into the workforce upon graduation, armed with the same tool used by many of our industry partners.
Alternatively, students may wish to purchase a more entry level camera for those who are budget minded. Our professors recommend the Canon EOS RP body with the kit lens W/RF 24-105mm IS STM Lens (Retail: $1,549).  Although this camera costs less it will still give students the opportunity to meet the needs of the program.
Alternatively, students may wish to purchase a more professional camera with better low light performance and all round quality. Our professors recommend the Canon EOS R6 body with the kit lens W/RF 24-105mm IS STM Lens (Retail: $3,449). Although this camera costs more money, it will perform better, exceeding the demands of the program.

Program Overview
Project management professionals have the knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to successfully manage projects for a wide range of industries. To remain competitive in a global economy, organizations are using project management expertise to shorten product development cycles; respond quickly and effectively to opportunities or threats; re-evaluate their processes; capitalize on technical knowledge within the organization; and control the bottom-line. Project management is one of the top skill sets sought by organizations to help ensure their objectives are met on time and on budget. In fact, it is expected that by 2020 there will be a greater need than there will be candidates for these roles. Students start with basics and through a rigorous two-semester program supported by experienced teachers, graduate with real, applicable project experience under their belts.
WEEKEND DELIVERY FORMAT
The weekend delivery format is designed and intended for students looking for opportunities to study full-time, without having to attend traditional weekday in-person classes. With weekend delivery, all classes will be offered fully online on Friday evening, Saturday and Sunday. There are also self-directed (asynchronous) hours of learning.

FAQ
Why do I apply internally to be accepted into the Supply Chain & Operations - Business - Transfer to Ontario Tech University Bachelor of Commerce (SCTU) program?


The SCTU program includes university courses. Ontario Tech requires students to apply and meet a minimum grade requirement for admission to their courses.

How do I apply internally to be accepted into the SCTU program?
An information session is planned where we provide details about the program and mandatory Ontario Tech application. There is an enforced due date for the Ontario Tech application and it is typically submitted online. Every student interested in the embedded program must submit the application.
How will I be informed if I’m eligible for the program or not? 


Once your final marks from each semester are received, Durham College will notify you of your eligibility via email to your DC email account. If you have completed all of your courses each semester and have a cumulative GPA of 3.5 (75%) or higher then you are eligible to begin the next semester. Please be sure that you check your dc email account regularly.

Can I apply for credit transfer?


If you have studied previously at Durham College or another recognized post-secondary institution, you may be eligible to receive credit for Durham College courses, however; Ontario Tech will not accept any credit transfers for any embedded course, students are required to complete all five embedded courses with Ontario Tech. Application and further information is available on MyCampus or by using this link, https://durhamcollege.ca/credittransfer.

What is the grade requirement to be in the program?


We recommend that students have a 4.0 or “A” (85-89%) average in their semester one, year one Durham courses, before they apply to the SCTU program for semester two; however, the requirement is a “B+” (75-79%) or 3.5 GPA in the Durham College courses. You must maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.5 in all Durham College courses and receive a minimum “C” (60-66%) grade in each of the Ontario Tech courses. Each institution has different grading systems. Please see each of the institutional charts.

Can I repeat a Ontario Tech course if I fail it?


Yes, but only one time and you will need to pay the full university fee to retake the course. See your DC student advisor for registration information.

What are the five embedded Ontario Tech courses that I need to take? 


The embedded Ontario Tech courses are:
Critical Thinking & Ethics,
Finance I,
Organizational Behaviour,
Financial Accounting and
Business Math I.

*Courses and program of studies are subject to change by Durham College and Ontario Tech.

What diploma will I graduate with? 


Durham College diploma will indicate: Supply Chain & Operations – Business (two year).

Can I major at Ontario Tech?


Please note, major requirements and eligibility is at the discretion of Ontario Tech. For additional inquiries please email FBITAdvising@uoit.ca.

If I complete the two year SCTU diploma, but I don’t want to continue to Ontario Tech can I enter year three Supply Chain & Operations –
Business Administration program at Durham?


Yes, but not directly. You would need to take the missing year two courses from Durham College prior to entering year three. You would need to take these courses as a part-time student or through Continuing Education (pending availability). It could delay a year of studies, because of the outstanding courses and third year only begins in September via day school.

Can I make schedule (timetable) changes?


Sometimes, but it is highly recommended that you don’t for the Durham College courses, and definitely not for the Ontario Tech courses. We also prefer that you remain in the scheduled block so you are together as a cohort. This makes it easier to plan sessions for you and get important information to you in person. Be prepared for fourteen weeks (the length of the semester) to be in class at Durham College anywhere from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. and Ontario Tech 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. throughout the week.

Being at two institutions are there any differences?


Yes, there are many. You are at two separate institutions with varying expectations, procedures and policies. You are required to adhere to both institutional policies. There can also be different break weeks and varying exam schedules (for instance, a Saturday night Ontario Tech exam). SCTU is a unique program and some services will require more attention. If you experience a delay in service or response time, please be patient.

What Learning Management System (LMS) does Ontario Tech use?


Ontario Tech uses Blackboard. Your embedded Ontario Tech courses will not appear on DC Connect; you will need to access Blackboard for the Ontario Tech course information.

For more information about Blackboard, please use this link https://itsc.uoit.ca/services/blackboard.php.

Are there additional fees for the Ontario Tech courses?


Yes, students will also be required to pay an additional tuition fee to Ontario Tech for one course in semester 2, two courses in semester 3 and two courses in semester 4. Ontario Tech tuition will be charged at the beginning of each semester starting in Semester 2. Fees are based on each academic year and are required to be paid by the Ontario Tech fee deadline. If you are receiving OSAP you are required to inform OSAP of the additional fees for the university courses.

Do I still use MyCampus?


Absolutely, MyCampus is for administrative records, registration, fees, and important messages are posted through MyCampus. Both institutions use MyCampus as a primary system, but with different tabs.

Where, how, and when do I pay the Ontario Tech fees?


Your account will be updated with the fees you owe through MyCampus (Ontario Tech tab). Please check your account and ensure you have paid all courses fees. You may pay these fees through a bank transfer or bank draft. Bank drafts can be submitted in person in the Software and Informatics Research Centre located across the street at 40 Conlin Road West.

If you have applied for OSAP and it is delayed, you will need to make an appointment in Student Awards and Financial Aid at Ontario Tech to make payment arrangements. You cannot have an OSAP deferment of fees for your Ontario Tech courses.

Please visit the following link regarding payment and refund deadlines: https://registrar.uoit.ca/fees-and-payment/payment/index.php.

There are a variety of ways to pay your tuition fees, compulsory ancillary fees and program associated fees.

Important: It may take five business days for payment to post to your MyCampus account.

Methods of payment


Please use this link for a list of payment options, methods of payment, acceptable and non-acceptable options, https://registrar.uoit.ca/fees-and-payment/tuition-and-fees/index.php.

What happens after semester two?


When your semester two final grades are available from both institutions (Ontario Tech final grades are typically posted a little after Durham College). Your grades will be reviewed to determine if you can proceed into year two of the SCTU program or if you will be transferred into the Supply Chain & Operations program. You are required to have a minimum 3.5 cumulative GPA and a minimum “C” grade in each of the Ontario Tech course(s). If you are continuing with the SCTU program you will be invoiced, pay your fees (Durham College fees are paid through Durham College), you will need to pay the Ontario Tech course fees to Ontario Tech directly (see fees for further information).

What happens after year two?


You are required to have successfully completed all year one and two courses with a cumulative GPA of 3.5 in your Durham College courses and a minimum “C” in each of the five embedded Ontario Tech courses to apply to enter year three of the four year (Hons) Bachelor of Commerce (general) degree at Ontario Tech. Ontario Tech in conjunction with Durham College schedule an information session (typically in March of semester four) to respond to questions and explain the application process for Ontario Tech. Please attend this information session for valuable information and an opportunity to ask any questions.

Supports are available through the Experiential Learning  office to assist students with securing their work terms. In addition, the Experiential Learning office is in contact with co-op students and their employers during the work terms to help with any questions.

Program Overview
Crossing borders and spanning oceans, supply chain is a global industry that provides endless opportunities for skilled professionals who can plan, control, execute and optimize a product’s flow from point of origin to point of consumption in the most economical way possible. Each major phase of a product’s movement through the supply chain has its own distinct business process and discipline, and supply chain professionals have the unique knowledge and skillset needed to effectively manage the intricacies of this process.
Considered one of the most essential sectors of Canada’s economy, there are currently more than 800,000 supply chain employees (excluding truck drivers) who work in a range of occupations and industries across the sector. Approximately 150,000 of these positions are at the professional or managerial level.
The Supply Chain Management – Global program is a strong choice for students with previous education or experience in business administration or operations, and will deepen their understanding of the complexity and interconnectedness of roles, work processes, transactions and stakeholders within and between supply chains, and the impact supply chain decisions can make on an organization’s financial prosperity.
