Program Overview
Civil engineering influences every aspect of our physical environment or infrastructure. Civil Engineering Technologists plan, design, construct, maintain and recycle the structures in our communities such as roads, bridges, highways, airports, pipelines and tunnels. These systems keep our transportation systems operating, water flowing and gas and electricity supplied to consumers. It is one of the most established engineering disciplines and by far one of the busiest.
In this program, you will be exposed to modern civil technologies and develop skills in computer assisted design and drafting (CAD), geographic information system (GIS), building information modelling (BIM), and safe working principles in accordance with various Canadian civil engineering codes, quality control standards and regulations.
You will also have two options to gain valuable experience in the workplace and will either complete a field placement or participate in the co-operative education (co-op) option of the program. Students can also access membership to the Toronto Construction Association.

 Co-operative Education (co-op) 
The best way to succeed in your field is to immerse yourself in it! Co-op is an excellent way to build your professional network, explore career paths and apply in-class teachings to real work situations. Co-op is a model of education that integrates academic learning with workplace learning in fields relevant to our students’ academic and personal goals. Similar to an academic course, work terms are a mandatory component of this form of experiential learning.

Program Details
With more than 50 per cent of your time spent in the labs and fields of the W. Galen Weston Centre for Food (Weston Centre), you will gain a unique hands-on opportunity to become familiar with the concepts that are critical to the food and agricultural industry, all within the context of a field-to-fork philosophy. You will learn in our fields, greenhouses, hoop house and state-of-the-art food chemistry and processing labs, while planning for, planting, tending to and harvesting more than 50 different varieties of produce, berry bushes, herbs and more.
Through the development of your own value-added food products, you will have a greater knowledge and understanding of the opportunities that come with food production. Whether you are interested in a career with a food company, managing a food operation, developing your own food product or owning a greenhouse or production farm, you will gain critical skills in modern farming concepts, food processing and food preservation to position you as an industry leader.
The Food and Farming program will offer you a hands-on opportunity to become familiar with the concepts of food production.
You will focus on:
Plant propagation
Soil and plant nutrition
Fruit and vegetable production under field, greenhouse, garden and container conditions
Food product development
Food processing including niche processing of local foods
Food and agriculture regulations
Food safety and microbiology
Disease and pest management
Business practices including product branding, entrepreneurship and marketing.
The program is offered at the college's Whitby campus, home of the W. Galen Weston Centre for Food. This incredible learning environment includes orchards, agricultural fields, greenhouses, food labs and more. Students also utilize the specialized laboratories at the college’s Oshawa campus and participate in field trips through the year.
Students also have an opportunity to contribute to projects connected to the Barrett Centre of Innovation in Sustainable Urban Agriculture. This unique centre is advancing knowledge, opportunities and activities that will lead to greater urban farming activities in communities across Ontario and beyond.
Please note: students will be required to purchase green tag safety boots in order to participate in many laboratory settings.

Project Lord Ridgeback
Project Lord Ridgeback (PLRB) is multi-disciplinary experiential learning exercise that simulates a local disaster. Interacting with actors who play victims, casualties, emotionally distressed persons and the elderly in a staged, choreographed event, students from a wide range of programs learn by acting and responding as they would in real emergencies. Subject matter experts design injects into disaster-related scenarios which simulate authentic workplace demands.
Following the mock disaster, students participate in follow up exercises to apply learning in mock court testimony, critical incident stress debrief, crime-scene lab work, and form completion specific to their program areas.
Student participants are from a wide range of DC programs including: Practical Nursing, Primary Care Paramedic, Police Foundations, Protection Security & Investigation, Paralegal, 911 Call Centre Communications, Advanced Law Enforcement and Investigations, Journalism Mass Media Program, Social Service Worker, Activation Co-ordination – Gerontology, Court Support Services.
","Living Lab
The Living Lab at Durham College mimics a typical residential unit, allowing students to work through real-life scenarios that depict several challenges they will face in their future careers. Complete with obstacles to problem solve and work around, such as a living room, bedroom, kitchen, and laundry room, students learn to not only care for the patient, but to be mindful of their environment as well. In an emergency, a person’s life can depend on the decision making and the abilities of the paramedic to take swift action; the Living Lab ensures that the students are well prepared and confident to meet the demand of this challenging career head on. Students plan and try out what they learn in the lab and are able to apply the new knowledge to future situations. By going beyond the theory learned in class and learning by doing, students get first-hand experience of practicing what has been taught to retain the life-saving skills and knowledge necessary to succeed.
